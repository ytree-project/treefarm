This is treefarm, a [yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt) extension for creating merger-trees.
The treefarm package was originally a part of [ytree](https://treefarm.readthedocs.io/), but is now
its own thing.

Currently, treefarm can only be installed from source.
To get the development version, clone this repository and install like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/ytree-project/treefarm
cd treefarm
pip install -e .
```

## Sample Data

Sampled data for making some small merger-trees is available on the
[yt Hub](https://girder.hub.yt/) in the
[ytree data](https://girder.hub.yt/#collection/59835a1ee2a67400016a2cda) collection.
