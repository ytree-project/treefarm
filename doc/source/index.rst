This is treefarm.
=================

``treefarm`` is an extension of the `yt <https://yt-project.org/>`_ analysis
toolkit for creating merger-trees. The ``treefarm`` package began as a submodule
of the `ytree <https://ytree.readthedocs.io/>`_ package, but is now its own
thing. ``treefarm`` can create merger-trees for halo catalog data support by
`yt <https://yt-project.org/>`_ for which halo particles can be loaded.
Currently, this is limited to Gadget FoF/Subfind catalogs. The resulting
merger-trees can be :ref:`loaded with ytree <ytree:load-treefarm>`.
