Contributing to ytree
=====================

ytree is a community project!

Contributions are welcome in the form of code, documentation, or
just about anything.  If you'd like to get involved, please do!

Since ytree is a project out of the yt community, the `yt Developer
Guide <http://yt-project.org/docs/dev/developing/index.html>`_
is a good place to start.  You can also contact the `yt users list
<http://lists.spacepope.org/listinfo.cgi/yt-users-spacepope.org>`_.
